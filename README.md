# flower-classification-api
This project demonstrates how to build, save, and deploy a simple machine learning model using Logistic Regression trained on the famous Iris dataset. The trained model is exposed through a Flask API, which allows users to send flower measurements as JSON input and receive the predicted Iris species as output.
